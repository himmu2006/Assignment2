    <p>Kolhua is a famous Buddhist excavation site situated approximately 65 km North-West of Patna. The excavations have revealed the famous Ashokan Pillar having a statue of lion on the top. Excavations also revealed, many other articles related to Buddhism.</p>
    <p>Emperor Ashoka built The Lion Pillar at Kolhua. It is made of a highly polished single piece of red sandstone, surmounted by a bell shaped capital, 18.3 m high. A life-size figure of a lion is placed on top of the pillar. There is a small tank here known as Ramkund. This pillar beside a brick stupa at Kolhua commemorates Buddha's last sermon.</p>

    <p>This Lofty stone column erected by priyadarshee Lord Ashok in 249 BC in village Lauriya under Areraj subdivision is situated on the left side of Areraj – Bettiah road. The pillar, known as “Stambh dharma lekh”, which bears in well preserved and well cut letters six of his edicts, is a single block of polished sandstone, 36 ½ feet in height above the ground with a base diameter of 41.8 inches and a diameter at the top of 37.6 inches. The weight of this portion only is very nearly 34 tons, but as these must be several feet of the shaft sunk in the earth. The actual weight of the whole block must be about 40 tons. This pillar has no Capital. According to a report that pillar was crowned with a statue of an animal, but it was transferred to the Kolkata museum.</p>
    <p>The edicts of king Ashoka are most clearly and heartily engraved, and are divided into two distinct portions, that to the worth containing 18 lines and that to the south 23 lines. But now these are not a good state of preservation and suffered from the effect of weather. The villages call the pillar as ‘Laur’ that is the phallus and the adjoining village is named after it Lauriya.</p>
    <p>The Archaeological Survey of India has classified the Ashokan pillar as a protected monument.</p>
    <p>The staff is helpful; the gardens surrounding the ancient relic are lush green, dotted with trees in the hot sun. The parking is in a shady litchi grove. At just Rs 10, you will not find a cooler parking lot for all the money in the world.

        With 2-3 cars parked on one side, the other side has 2-3 string charpoys where elderly men take an afternoon siesta. Children sit on a tree branch chatting and laughing.
        
        The idyllic scene is a perfect start to the Ashokan architectural wonder that costs just Rs 25 as ticket fee.</p>
