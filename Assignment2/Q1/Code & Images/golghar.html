    <p>Golghar, an enormous granary, was built by Captain John Garstin for British army in 1786, after the terrible impact of 1770 famine. The winding stairway around this monument offers a brilliant view of the city and the Ganga flowing nearby. </p>
    <p>It is pillar-less with a wall of thickness of 3.6 m at the base height of 29 m.. One can climb at the top of the Golghar through the 145 steps of its spiral stairway around it. The spiral staircase was designed to facilitate the passage of the workers who deliver their load through a hole at the top, and descend the other stairs.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>According to a contemporary inscription at its base, the Golghar in Patna was intended to be just the first of a series of huge grain stores. In the end, however, no others were ever built. The granary was "part of a general plan â€¦ for the perpetual prevention of famine in these provinces".
    <p>The beehive - shaped structure was designed by John Garstin of the Bengal Engineers, part of the East India Company's Bengal Army. Its construction was completed on 20 July 1786.</p>
     <p>   A drive to improve the appearance of the structure was begun in 2002.</p>

     <h2>Architecture</h2>
     <hr>
     <p>Built in the Stupa architecture, the building has a height of 29 m. It is pillar-less with a wall of thickness of 3.6 m at the base. One can climb to the top of the Golghar via its 145-step spiral stairway. The spiral staircase was designed to facilitate the passage of the workers who loaded and unloaded the grain in the granary, who had to carry grain-bags up one flight, deliver their load through a hole at the top, and descend the other stairs.</p>
