    <p>Maner is a small town located 25 kilometers (16 miles) west of Patna on NH 30, in Bihar. Maner Sharif shelters two very popular Muslim tombs: One of the tombs is of Sufi saint Makhdoom Yahya Maneri, known as the Bari Dargah (the great shrine). The other one is of Makhdum Shah Daulat, popularly called Chhoti Dargah (the small shrine).</p>
    <p>There is a big dome on the top whose ceiling is full of different markings depicted from the Quran. In the mediaeval time, Maner Sharif used to be the principal site of learning and knowledge in the region.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Makhdoom Shah Daulat died in Maner Sharif in 1608 and Ibrahim Khan Kakar Governor of Bihar, built a mausoleum to him that was completed in 1616.[1]

        The domed mausoleum's walls are adorned with intricate designs and its ceiling has passages from the Qur'an. Maner Sharif also has a mosque constructed by Ibrahim Khan (governor of Bihar) in 1619.[2] Maner Sharif was a regional centre of learning and is where the Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini studied.</p>
    <h2>Maner Ka Laddu</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Maner is known for its variant of laddu known as Motichoor Laddu made with ghee and promoted by local vendors as being made using the sugar-sweet waters of the Sone river. Maner laddu featured in the Bollywood movie Khudgarz.

        Maner Sweets is the oldest and most famous sweet shop which makes authentic Maner ka Laddoo (Laddu). Aamir Khan visited this place while travelling via this route for movie promotion.
        
        In addition of Maner's laddu and Dargah sharif, Maner also has Buddhist temple, Jain temple and significances of other religions, hence, it is the emblem of unity diversity.
